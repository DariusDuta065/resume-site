## A Test with Tailwind Prose Classes

With the new [@tailwindcss/typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) module I can add prose modifiers that will render to the output HTML. This allows you to style HTML tags individually with i.e. `prose-h*:text-color-*00`

You can change link colors too and define hover with `prose prose-a:text-pink-700 hover:prose-a:text-cyan-700` - example:
[gohugo.io](https://gohugo.io)

- Note that in standard prose code snippets show the ` for some reason. So in standard prose you get:

&#96;`<code>Something</code>`&#96;

But I want want:

`<code>Something</code>`

Remove those extra lines you want the &#96;`ticks`&#96;. Tailwind uses them on their website.
