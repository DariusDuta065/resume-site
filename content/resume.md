### {{< resume/title name="Twine" url="https://twine.net" >}}
{{< resume/subtitle text="2020 â€” 2021" >}}

Twine is an online platform of jobs and contracts for freelancers. The CEO, Stuart Logan, has attracted a dynamic and motivated team that quickly formed a welcoming and diverse culture.

I joined Twine as a software engineer, and, following the departure of our head of engineering, I was promoted to interim lead software engineer and also held the role of scrum master for the rest of my time at Twine.

#### Achievements

- Migrated the whole platform to a new domain (around 15 CloudFormation stacks), resulting in a 10% increase in organic traffic after one month and a ~0.35% increase in the overall conversion rate
- Designed and implemented a cost-effective serverless chat system using websockets that requires almost no maintenance (API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB)
- Improved the effectiveness of the Customer Success team by building features on top of the existing Slack bot, such that they could easily view details about incoming jobs and pitches, and moderate them directly through Slack
- As the scrum master of my team, I promoted agile values and encouraged knowledge sharing and a growth-oriented mindset

#### Tech used at Twine

React, Laravel, Cloud Formation, Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, EC2, S3, RDS, DynamoDB, API Gateway

### {{< resume/title name="Lumico Digital" url="https://www.lumico.io" >}}
{{< resume/subtitle text="2017 â€” 2019" >}}

Lumico is an IT agency that works with a plethora of clients globally. I joined them at the beginning of my second year in university. I am grateful to the two owners, Steve Kennington and Stephen Briney, for offering me mentorship throughout the years.

I belive that this exposure to different projects and types of clients is a big part of my development until now and has made me understand and adopt the continously learning and growth mindset.

#### Achievements

- Within my first month, I delivered an API integration project, written in ASP.NET Core, for a popular insurance company in South East Asia
- From my senior colleagues, I learnt many aspects about working with clients --- especially having clear communication in a simple language, even when explaining technical concepts
- There were a couple of mobile apps built, most in React Native, but one of them was exclusive on Android and written in Kotlin
- The most challenging project involved IoT devices placed underground that collect and transmit different data from the British water network
  - It entailed an event-driven architecture, with time series data stored in InfluxDB, aggregates stored in DynamoDB, and a fully serverless Lambda back-end, fronted by a React app

#### Tech used at Lumico (by project/client)

React, Lambda, API Gateway, S3, RDS, DynamoDB, InfluxDB

ASP.NET Core Web API, Entity Framework, Azure App Service

Kotlin, Dagger, RxJava, MVVM arch

React Native

### University of Southampton
{{< resume/subtitle text="2016 â€” 2019" >}}

The Computer Science course at the university of Southampton gave me a complete overview of this domain; the course covered everything from the basics of a computer system and algorithms & data structures, to distributed systems, advanced databases, and machine learning.

However, there is only so much that can be taught and especially understood logically in the 3 years of teaching. To make up for the lack of depth in some areas, I find myself still reading about concepts taught during uni, with the end goal of further consolidating my knowledge.

My 3rd year project involved _semantic data streaming_ and it aimed to compare and contrast two different methods of streaming [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) data; one using [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL), and the other one using the native functionality that comes with Apache Kafka.

At the end of the 3rd year, I graduated with first-class honours, prepared to put the theory into practice.

### 'Tudor Vianu' National College of Computer Science
{{< resume/subtitle text="2012 â€” 2016" >}}

I was always interested in technology and computers. Just before high school, I realised I wanted to learn more about programming. There is only one public high school that specialises in computer science in Bucharest. Despite its mighty entrance requirements (being the 3rd best high school in Bucharest), I managed to get the grades necessary for my admission.

The Romanian curriculum covers a lot, especially in maths and informatics; we were taught algorithms and data structures in C++ (and sometimes C#), which helped me be more comfortable with the first year in university.

At the end of college comes the _"maturity"_ exam, the Romanian baccalaureate. Having secured the equivalent of AÙ­AÙ­AÙ­ (10 in maths, 10 in compsci, 9.60 in Romanian) in the baccalaureate, I was then able to pursue Computer Science at the UK uni I personally liked the most.
